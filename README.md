# NumericalModelling
This is a repo for the solutions to the projects of ELEC 518 Numerical Modelling and Simulation given in 2018 Fall at Ko√ß University.

Codes are given in matlab with amazing results on reducing the calcaulation time. Provided codes also employ some advanced computanioal methods to divide the needed computational power for simulations to be succesfully computed on ordinary computers.

This is an amazing repo if you want to reduce the needed computantional power and time for your simulations or calculations that employ big matrices. Use at your caution. 

## !Caution!

There appears to be bug at HW1 and HW4. Since I just found my source code and it has been quite some time I'm not sure if this was a finalized version or the one with some bugs. But I remember that the bug was very easy to fix, if there are any.
